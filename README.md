# email-scraper
Python script; takes a domain name and prints out any emails found on the domain


## Running list of things that need fixing:
 - Simple appends 'http://' to domains if 'http' not found in string -- make more elegant!
 - Handle errors from mechanize like... 'request disallowed by robots.txt', etc.
